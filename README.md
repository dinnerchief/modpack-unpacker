# Curseforge modpack loader

A simple unpacker of Sourceforge modpacks with parallel installation of mods.

It does NOT install the client Forge modloader.

Perhaps the functionality will be supplemented. Write to the Issue

# Usage
1. Run
```shell
python3 main.py <path/to/modpack.zip>
```
2. Done!
